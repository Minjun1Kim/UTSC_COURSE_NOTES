Haskell

Part 2:
Syntax: Moar context-free grammars; simple parsers

Semantics: By toy language models in Haskell
Why Haskell: almost like math definition, and executable

Evaluation Order

Define f(x) = 4
Now what is f(1/0)?
Call by value (most languages): Evaluate 1/0 first. Error.

Lazy evaluation (Haskell): Don't evaluate 1/0 yet, just plug in as is.
x is unused => f(1/0) = 4

define: trio x = [x,x,x]
[inferred] type: t -> [t]
