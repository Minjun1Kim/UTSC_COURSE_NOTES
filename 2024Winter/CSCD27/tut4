Authenticated Encryption

1. 
E_k(m || H(m))
E_k(m) || H(E_k(m))

2. Send E_k(m) || H(E_k(m))

3. Match E_k(m with H(E_k(m))
Concatenate the nonce to the beginning of the message then

n || E_k(m) || H(E_k(m)) 

Asymmetric Encryption

1. E_k(n,m) = c

Key Exchange

every conversation different key
faster: K = (A^b) mod p

Public key infrastructure

1. get a trusted certificate and send it to Alice
2.
