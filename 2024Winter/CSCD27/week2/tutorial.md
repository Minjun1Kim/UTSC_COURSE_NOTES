1. For each attack below, discuss the security property/ies as either “confidentiality”, “integrity”, “availability” that is/are at risk .

Confidentiality:

read the solutions submitted by other users
read the handout of a challenge before its release data
steal all usernames and passwords
opens a backdoor on the server as root

Integrity:

modify its own solution after the deadline
submit a solution to a challenge on behalf of another user
delete someone’s else solution
steal all usernames and passwords (half-way between integrity and confidentiality)
use the server to mine bitcoins (tampering)
opens a backdoor on the server as root

Availability:

shutdown the server
prevent users from submitting solutions
use the server to mine bitcoins (cpu-intensive)
opens a backdoor on the server as root


2. Now, let’s do it the other way around! Come up with 3 possible attacks on SecLab, one for each security property and different than the ones given above.

Confidentiality: finding the names of the people on the leaderboard <br/>
Integrity: Modify the instructions or a deadline of a challenge <br/>
Availability: 

Risk Assessment: 

Risk Exposure = Probability * Impact <br/>
Rank them in a table.

The impact factor is much greater. More to lose

- political leader
- the founder of a startup (lots of money/investment, data, resources)
- a public figure (famous/severity/popularity)
- a UofT student
